THE FAIR BREEZE BLEW, THE WHITE FOAM FLEW,
THE FURROW FOLLOWED FREE:
WE WERE THE FIRST THAT EVER BURST
INTO THAT SILENT SEA.

DOWN DROPT THE BREEZE, THE SAILS DROPT DOWN,
'TWAS SAD AS SAD COULD BE;
AND WE DID SPEAK ONLY TO BREAK
THE SILENCE OF THE SEA!

DAY AFTER DAY, DAY AFTER DAY,
WE STUCK, NOR BREATH NOR MOTION;
AS IDLE AS A PAINTED SHIP
UPON A PAINTED OCEAN.

WATER, WATER, EVERY WHERE,
AND ALL THE BOARDS DID SHRINK;
WATER, WATER, EVERY WHERE,
NOR ANY DROP TO DRINK.

        SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE
