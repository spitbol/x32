*  err.spt
*
*  find a near optimum compression for a spitbol error message file.
*
*  spitbol -u "machine" -1<input file> -2<output file> err
*
*  the variable machine is set equal to the uppercase name of the machine
*  being processed.  usage is optional.
*
*  technique:
*	the 159 characters from 1 to 31, and 128 to 255 are used to
*	represent words and phrases from the error file.  the error
*	list is then reduced to two character strings:
*		1. an error message string
*		2. a phrase string
*
*	within each string, the individual messages or phrases are
*	separated by '\0' characters. the nth element of either
*	string can be found by scanning and counting '\0's.
*
*	when a character with value 1 to 31, or 128 to 255 is encountered,
*	it should be mapped to an ordinal number in the range [1-159], and
*	the phrase string consulted to obtain the appropriate phrase.
*
*	naturally (this being snobol4), phrases may recursively contain
*	other code characters.
*
*	the problem reduces to finding the 159 phrases that will
*	provide the greatest compression.  for any phrase p of length s
*	that occurs n times in the source error message file, replacing
*	it with a single character and adding it to the phrase string
*	produces a savings of n*(s-1) - s - 1 characters.
*
*	each of the n occurrances of p are replaced by a single character,
*	for a savings of n*(s-1) in the error message string.  the phrase
*	string is lengthened by s + 1 characters (1 for the '\0' at the end).
*
*	for a unique phrase (n=1), the savings is -2, that is, there is no
*	savings, but rather a net gain of 2 characters.
*
*	a sneaky pattern is used to generate all single- and multi-word
*	phrases in a particular error message.  each phrase indexes a table
*	entry that counts the cost savings associated with that phrase.
*
*	all error messages are scanned to build this savings table, which
*	is then rsorted to obtain the phrase that if chosen, would produce
*	the greatest savings.  taking that phrase, all occurrances of it
*	in all error messages are replaced by a single character, and the
*	phrase is added to a phrase array.
*
*	the entire process is repeated again, rather than just taking the
*	next best entry from the table.  this allows new combinations to
*	materialize, as a result of having replaced the phrase with a single
*	character, and also eliminates the problem of now obsolete table
*	entries that partially overlapped the chosen phrase.  the process
*	is repeated for all 159 entries that can be accommodated in the
*	phrase table.
*
*	as each phrase is selected, the phrase array is also scanned
*	to see any substitutions can be made there.
*
*	the program makes considerable use of gimpel's seq function to
*	sequence through various arrays.
*
*	the output is a series of data statements in generic 68000 assembly
*	language.  there are two types of pseudo-ops:
*		1.  byte	to define decimal data bytes
*		2.  ascii	to define an ascii string
*
*	needless to say, it does take some time to grind out the results (22
*	minutes with 68k spitbol on a unix pc, 22 hours with snobol4+ on
*	a pc/xt).
*
*	note: moving the lower case characters (64-95) from the normal
*	      character set to the special set (thus providing for 191
*	      phrases instead of 159), only saved 40 bytes in the output
*	      file, and was deemed unnecessarily restrictive.
*
*	      concatenating the error and phrase arrays prior to each call
*	      roduced a less optimal packing, and was discarding
*	      in favor of just using the error array to pick the next
*	      phrase for compression.

* set machine definition flag, if any.
*
	ident(host(0))				:s(nomachine)
	$replace(host(0),&lcase,&ucase) = 1
        output = "machine: " host(0)

* tab character
	tab	= char(9)

*
*  comma delimited string of decimal bytes:
        db      = 'db'
	byte	= tab db tab

*  delim delimited string of 'normal' ascii characters (32-127)
	delim	= '"'
        ascii   = tab 'db' tab

*  comment lead-in character
*
        comment = ';'

	specials = f1 f2

*  functions
*

*  seq(s,n)
*
*	will sequence through a set of statements until failure is detected.
*	the indexing variable is given by the name n. from gimpel, "algorithms
*	in snobol4."
*

*  entry point:  initialize indexing variable.  then convert arg_s to code.
*
seq	$arg_name  =  0
	arg_s  =  code(arg_s  ' :s(seq_1)f(seq_2)')
+						:f(error)

*  increment indexing variable by 1 and spring off to compiled code.
*  return will be to seq_1 or seq_2.
*

*  control flows to seq_2 if a fail was detected.  if first time through
*  fail;  otherwise succeed.

*  best(err,n)
*
*	select the best phrase from the error message array -- that is,
*	the phrase that will provide the greatest savings if replaced
*	by a one character code.
*
*	technique:  build a table of the savings associated with all
*	possible phrases in the err array, sort it, and select the best.
*	then make all possible replacements, using integer n for the code.
*
	define('best(err,n)t,j')		:(best_end)

*

*  any more.

*  generate(s,t)
*
*	generate all phrases from a string s, and add their potential
*	savings to table t.  the first occurence of a phrase produces
*	a savings of -2 (net loss).  subsequent occurences provide an
*	incremental savings of size(phrase) -1.
*
*	the one phrase we do not generate from s is the entire
*	string s itself, since moving it to the phrase table is
*	meaningless.  (assuming unique input strings.)
*
*	this relies upon fail pattern to generate all the permutations.
*	put a trace on variable w to watch the results.
*

*  repl(x,i,s,n)
*
*	replace string s in $x with char(n).
*	this must be isolated into a function to prevent seq from
*	terminating early when a pattern match fails.
*
	define('repl(x,s,n)')				:(repl_end)
repl	$x ? s = char(n)				:f(return)s(repl)

*  putout(s,i)
*
*	output string s as a series of ascii and byte data statements.
*	i is the index of the string being compressed.

*  pattern to break s into normal and special characters.
