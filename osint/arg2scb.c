/   arg2scb( req, argc, argv, scptr, maxs )
/
/   arg2scb() makes a copy of the req-th argument in the argv array.
/   The copy is appended to the string in the SCBLK provided.
/
/   Parameters:
/	req	number of argument to copy
/	argc	number of arguments
/	argv	pointer to array of pointers to strings (arguments)
/	scptr	pointer to SCBLK to receive copy of argument
/	maxs	maximum number of characters to append.
/   Returns:
/	Length of argument copied or -1 if req is out of range.
/   Side Effects:
/	Modifies contents of passed SCBLK (scptr).
/	SCBLK length field is incremented.
