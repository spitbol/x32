*/

/*
/	zysem - get error message text
/
/	zysem returns the error message associated with an error number.
/
/	An assembly language file, errors.s contains a compressed form
/	of the error messages.  On the Macintosh, error messages are
/	in the resource fork of the application, uncompressed.  This
/	allows the user to easily translate them into any language.
/
/	Error messages are compressed into two character arrays.  Segments
/	within these arrays are delineated by \0 characters.  To find the
/	Nth segment, it is necessary to scan the array for the Nth \0.  The
/	segment begins at the next character position.
/
/	The first array, errors, contains 330 segments for the primary
/	error messages.  Within a segment, there are ascii characters
/	in the range 32-127, which are taken verbatim, and character
/	values 1-31 and 128-255, which are special characters.
/
/	The special characters are mapped into the range [1-159], where
/	they index segments in the second array, phrases.  Segments within
/	phrases follow the same rules as those within arrays, and may
/	contain special characters themself.
/
/	This expansion code is by necessity recursive.  This code and
/	the data within errors.s were coded for minimum space, not speed,
/	since it is used infrequently.
/
/	Parameters:
/	    WA - error number
/	Returns:
/	    XR - pointer to SCBLK containing error message (null string is ok)
/	Exits:
/	    None

/
/	The function returns the number of characters copied.
