A "load module" is an executable file containing the entire SPITBOL
system in addition to your program's object code and data. 

Load modules can be created just prior to program execution by
specifying the -w command line option. 

Load modules may also be written during program execution by calling EXIT(3,filename).

Since load modules contain a copy of the entire SPITBOL system, they
are subject to the terms of the GPLv2 (or later) license. You must meet the terms
of the GPLv3 license if you distribute a load module.

If a load module is created after you have used SPITBOL's LOAD
function to load an external function, then the files that have been
loaded are subject to the terms of the GPLv3 license.
